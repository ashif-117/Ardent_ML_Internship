📧 Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the content of emails, the model classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham).

Spam detection is a classic and practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, widely used in real-world email systems to improve user experience and security.

The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step explanation and reproducibility.

🎯 Objectives
