🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By applying K-Means clustering, customers are grouped based on their purchasing behavior and characteristics.

Customer segmentation helps businesses better understand their customers, enabling targeted marketing, personalized services, and improved customer satisfaction.

The project is implemented in Python and presented through a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.

🎯 Objectives

Understand customer behavior through data analysis

Apply unsupervised learning for customer segmentation

Identify distinct customer groups

Visualize clusters for better business insights

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related features such as:

Customer ID

Annual Income

Spending Score

(Other relevant attributes if applicable)

The data is used without predefined labels, making it suitable for clustering techniques.

🤖 Algorithm Used

K-Means Clustering

An unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters.

📊 Visualization

Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters

Scatter plots to visualize customer segments

Cluster centroids visualization

✅ Results

The model successfully segments customers into distinct clusters based on their behavior. These clusters can be used by businesses to:

Identify high-value customers

Design personalized marketing strategies

Improve customer retention

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone this repository:
