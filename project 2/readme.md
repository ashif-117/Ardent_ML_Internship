🩺 Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical diagnostic data, the model classifies tumors as benign or malignant. The goal is to demonstrate how data science and machine learning can assist in early disease detection and healthcare decision-making.

The entire implementation is done in Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook for better clarity, step-by-step explanation, and reproducibility.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze breast cancer diagnostic data

Perform data preprocessing and feature analysis

Train machine learning models for classification

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

Predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains medical features extracted from breast cancer tumor images.

Each data point is labeled as Benign (B) or Malignant (M).

Features include measurements like radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, etc.

(Dataset source is commonly the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset)
